## [**SASS/SCSS**](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)

Sass is a stylesheet language thatâ€™s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.

**CSS Compatible**

Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS. We take this compatibility seriously, so that you can seamlessly use any available CSS libraries.

**Feature Rich**

Sass boasts more features and abilities than any other CSS extension language out there. The Sass Core Team has worked endlessly to not only keep up, but stay ahead.

**Mature**

Sass has been actively supported for almost 15 years by its loving Core Team.

**Frameworks**

There are an endless number of frameworks built with Sass. Compass, Bourbon, and Susy just to name a few.
