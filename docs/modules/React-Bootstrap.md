## [**React-Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)

Quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites with Bootstrap, the worldâ€™s most popular front-end open source toolkit.

**Rebuilt with React**


React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.

As one of the oldest React libraries, React-Bootstrap has evolved and grown alongside React, making it an excellent choice as your UI foundation.

**Bootstrap at its core**

Built with compatibility in mind, we embrace our bootstrap core and strive to be compatible with the world's largest UI ecosystem.

By relying entirely on the Bootstrap stylesheet, React-Bootstrap just works with the thousands of Bootstrap themes you already love.


**Accessible by default**

The React component model gives us more control over form and function of each component.

Each component is implemented with accessibility in mind. The result is a set of accessible-by-default components, over what is possible from plain Bootstrap.
